# Digital-School-Admission-Application-Form
This project is a responsive web-based application form designed to digitize the manual student enrollment process. Based on a handwritten reference, this interface transforms a static list of requirements into a clean, modern, and interactive user experience. It allows guardians or administrators to easily input student data for school records.
